Comment:
 The zip files in javadocs were removed because we build the documentation from
 source anyway. They also could have made the build unreproducible. The .js
 file was removed because of DFSG concerns. This is not the preferred form of
 modification.

Comment:
 The source tree contains a test.jar file, this is not a code dependency
 but a sample jar file processed by the tests to check if paranamer is able
 to parse a class in a jar. The actual source code of the class in this jar
 is defined in BytecodeReadingParanamerTestCase.java and covered by the same
 license.
